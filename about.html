  	<h2>Nicholas Arsenault</h2>
  	<p>
 		I am a 5th year Computer Science student at WSU, and this is not my first time working with databases
		or HTML. I definitely wouldn't say I'm experienced, I've just worked with MySQL on an Android app project
		last semester. I've always enjoyed coding and scripting, and I've been getting into Linux and Bash much more
		recently. So far, I'm enjoying my courses, and very interested in developing some more database knowledge!
