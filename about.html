  	<h2>Nicholas Arsenault</h2>
  	<p>
 		I am a 5th year Computer Science student at WSU, and this is not my first time working with databases
		or HTML. I definitely wouldn't say I'm experienced, I've just worked with MySQL on an Android app project
		last semester. I've always enjoyed coding and scripting, and I've been getting into Linux and Bash much more
		recently. So far, I'm enjoying my courses, and very interested in developing some more database knowledge!

	<h2>Will Esparza</h2>
	<p>
	    I am a 7th year Computer Science student at WSU. I have not previously worked on making a database but I've had
	    some experience interacting with them at work. I have worked with Java, HTML, CSS and some XML in the past 
	    through my classes and at other jobs I have held. I am looking forward to learn more about building a database
	    and working with SQL.

	<h2>Andy James</h2>
	<p>
	    My name is Andy. I'm in my 5th and final year at Wayne State. I'm pretty experienced in most OOP languages 
	    (C++/Java) with a bit of experience in Python and JS as well. I don't have much experience with SQL or
	    databases so I'm really excited to learn more about this during the semester.
