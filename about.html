  <h2>Longing for Nostalgia</h2>
  <p>
  Anyone who's been paying games since they were little has a bout of nostalgia later on in life when
  they are much older. I personally have been longing for that nostalgic feel for several years since I
  missed playing on my Sega Genesis. That same feeling of nostalgia has fueled my interest in game collecting.
  What everybody may long for may vary widely, but we all at one point have or will want to pursue our childhood
  nostalgia of playing retro video games. Yes, there are many ways to approach this, and usually much cheaper too,
  with retro pi devices loaded with hundreds of games, newer consoles offering a chance to play games of the past,
  online emulators, etc.

  <h2>Purpose of This Site</h2>
  <p>
  This site is dedicated to those who long having the physical copies of the games they played
  or wished to play, as there is a certain unique feel of loading a cartridge into the slot and flipping the switch on
  as you grab your controller to get ready for a classic adventure of your choosing. Here I will share tips I have learned
  over the past two years of being a retro game collector.
